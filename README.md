This repository contains my personal projects and contributions. 

I am passionate about machine learning, data science, physics, and I am always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies.

### Physics Projects

* **Inflationary Dynamics in string inspired Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity:** This project explores the dynamics of inflation in a string theory inspired model of gravity.

* **Bottom-up reconstruction of viable GW170817 compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories:** This project reconstructs viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories that are compatible with the GW170817 gravitational wave event.

* **Phase transitions in quark-hadron stars:** This project investigates the phase transitions that occur in the core of quark-hadron stars

### Contributions

* **Cosmic Inflation: From Observations to Particle Models Workshop:** I gave a talk at this workshop on my research in inflation.

* **Member of the local organizing committee for the Recent Advances in Cosmology and Modified Gravity Conference:** I helped organize this conference and presented a poster on my work.

### Skills

* Proficient in Python, machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and data analysis tools like SQL and pandas.

* Experienced in data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization.

* Strong understanding of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.
